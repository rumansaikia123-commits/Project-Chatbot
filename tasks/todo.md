# Project Chatbot — Build Plan (Guwahati Tourism Guide)

## Phase 1: Backend setup
- [x] Set up the Node.js project (creates `package.json`, the file that tracks which packages we use)
- [x] Install packages: `express` (runs the backend server), `@google/genai` (talks to Gemini — switched from Claude to keep this free), `dotenv` (loads your secret key from `.env`)
- [x] Write `server.js` — a small server with one job: receive a message from the chat box, send it to Gemini along with the Guwahati-guide instructions, send the reply back
- [x] Write the chatbot's "system prompt" — instructions that make it a Guwahati-only guide (declines off-topic questions like Mumbai/Delhi), refined/classy tone, follow-up-aware, with a placeholder section for curated local tips

## Phase 2: Frontend (the webpage)
- [x] Build `public/index.html` — the chat page structure
- [x] Style it (`public/style.css`) — full-page night photo of Guwahati as background, glassy chat card, gold accents, elegant serif title
- [x] Write `public/script.js` — handles typing a message, showing the conversation, calling the backend, remembering messages during the visit

## Phase 3: Connect and test locally
- [x] Add your real Gemini API key to `.env` (you did this step directly — never pasted in chat)
- [x] Run the server locally and test in the browser: Guwahati questions, itinerary requests, off-topic refusal, and follow-ups all confirmed working
- [x] Fixed along the way: outdated model names (both `claude-sonnet-4-5` and later `gemini-2.5-flash`) corrected to the current live model

## Phase 4: Save progress
- [ ] Commit the working chatbot to git
- [ ] Push to the `Project-Chatbot` GitHub repo (will confirm with you first)

## Pre-release audit fixes (all verified working via live tests)
- [x] Server now uses `process.env.PORT` so it works on real hosting (was hardcoded to 3000)
- [x] Malformed/invalid requests now return a clean error instead of leaking server file paths
- [x] Missing/empty messages return an accurate `400` error instead of a misleading 500
- [x] Added a response length limit (`maxOutputTokens`) to keep replies concise and cost predictable
- [x] Pinned required Node.js version (`>=20.0.0`) in `package.json` for reliable hosting
- [x] Fixed `package.json`'s `"main"` field to point at the real entry file (`server.js`)

## Later (not in v1)
- [ ] You provide curated Guwahati content (places, tips) — I fold it into the system prompt
- [ ] Deploy to free hosting (e.g. Render) so you get a real shareable link
- [ ] Optional future features: photos, multiple languages, password protection
